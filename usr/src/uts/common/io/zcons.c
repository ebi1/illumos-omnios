/*
 * Zone Console Driver.
 *
 * This driver, derived from the pts/ptm drivers, is the pseudo console driver
 * for system zones.  Its implementation is straightforward.  Each instance
 * of the driver represents a global-zone/local-zone pair (this maps in a
 * straightforward way to the commonly used terminal notion of "manager side"
 * and "subsidiary side", and we use that terminology throughout).
 *
 * Instances of zcons are onlined as children of /pseudo/zconsnex@1/
 * by zoneadmd in userland, using the devctl framework; thus the driver
 * does not need to maintain any sort of "admin" node.
 *
 * The driver shuttles I/O from manager side to subsidiary side and back.  In a
 * break from the pts/ptm semantics, if one side is not open, I/O directed
 * towards it will simply be discarded.  This is so that if zoneadmd is not
 * holding the manager side console open (i.e. it has died somehow), processes
 * in the zone do not experience any errors and I/O to the console does not
 * hang.
 *
 * TODO: we may want to revisit the other direction; i.e. we may want
 * zoneadmd to be able to detect whether no zone processes are holding the
 * console open, an unusual situation.
 *
 *
 *
 * MANAGER SIDE IOCTLS
 *
 * The ZC_HOLDSUBSID and ZC_RELEASESUBSID ioctls instruct the manager side of
 * the console to hold and release a reference to the subsidiary side's vnode.
 * They are meant to be issued by zoneadmd after the console device node is
 * created and before it is destroyed so that the subsidiary's STREAMS anchor,
 * ptem, is preserved when ttymon starts popping STREAMS modules from within
 * the associated zone.  This guarantees that the zone console will always have
 * terminal semantics while the zone is running.
 *
 * Here is the issue: the ptem module is anchored in the zone console
 * (subsidiary side) so that processes within the associated non-global zone
 * will fail to pop it off, thus ensuring that the subsidiary will retain
 * terminal semantics.  When a process attempts to pop the anchor off of a
 * stream, the STREAMS subsystem checks whether the calling process' zone is
 * the same as that of the process that pushed the anchor onto the stream and
 * cancels the pop if they differ.  zoneadmd used to hold an open file
 * descriptor for the subsidiary while the associated non-global zone ran, thus
 * ensuring that the subsidiary's STREAMS anchor would never be popped from
 * within the non-global zone (because zoneadmd runs in the global zone).
 * However, this file descriptor was removed to make zone console management
 * more robust.  sad(7D) is now used to automatically set up the subsidiary's
 * STREAMS modules when the zone console is freshly opened within the
 * associated non-global zone.  However, when a process within the non-global
 * zone freshly opens the zone console, the anchor is pushed from within the
 * non-global zone, making it possible for processes within the non-global zone
 * (e.g., ttymon) to pop the anchor and destroy the zone console's terminal
 * semantics.
 *
 * One solution is to make the zcons device hold the subsidiary open while the
 * associated non-global zone runs so that the STREAMS anchor will always be
 * associated with the global zone.  Unfortunately, the subsidiary cannot be
 * opened from within the zcons driver because the driver is not reentrant: it
 * has an outer STREAMS perimeter.  Therefore, the next best option is for
 * zcons to provide an ioctl interface to zoneadmd to manage holding and
 * releasing the subsidiary side of the console.  It is sufficient to hold the
 * subsidiary side's vnode and bump the associated snode's reference count to
 * preserve the subsidiary's STREAMS configuration while the associated zone
 * runs, so that's what the ioctls do.
 *
 *
 * ZC_HOLDSUBSID
 *
 * This ioctl takes a file descriptor as an argument.  It effectively gets a
 * reference to the subsidiary side's minor node's vnode and bumps the
 * associated snode's reference count.  The vnode reference is stored in the
 * zcons device node's soft state.  This ioctl succeeds if the given file
 * descriptor refers to the subsidiary side's minor node or if there is already
 * a reference to the subsidiary side's minor node's vnode in the device's soft
 * state.
 *
 *
 * ZC_RELEASESUBSID
 *
 * This ioctl takes a file descriptor as an argument.  It effectively releases
 * the vnode reference stored in the zcons device node's soft state (which was
 * previously acquired via ZC_HOLDSUBSID) and decrements the reference count of
 * the snode associated with the vnode.  This ioctl succeeds if the given file
 * descriptor refers to the subsidiary side's minor node or if no reference to
 * the subsidiary side's minor node's vnode is stored in the device's soft
 * state.
 *
 *
 * Note that the file descriptor arguments for both ioctls must be cast to
 * integers of pointer width.
 *
 * Here's how the dance between zcons and zoneadmd works:
 *
 *     Zone boot:
 *     1.  While booting the zone, zoneadmd creates an instance of zcons.
 *     2.  zoneadmd opens the manager and subsidiary sides of the new zone
 *         console and issues the ZC_HOLDSUBSID ioctl on the manager side,
 *         passing its file descriptor for the subsidiary side as the ioctl
 *         argument.
 *     3.  zcons holds the subsidiary side's vnode, bumps the snode's reference
 *         count, and stores a pointer to the vnode in the device's soft
 *         state.
 *     4.  zoneadmd closes the manager and subsidiary sides and continues to
 *         boot the zone.
 *
 *     Zone halt:
 *     1.  While halting the zone, zoneadmd opens the manager and subsidiary
 *         sides of the zone's console and issues the ZC_RELEASESUBSID ioctl on
 *         the manager side, passing its file descriptor for the subsidiary
 *         side as the ioctl argument.
 *     2.  zcons decrements the subsidiary side's snode's reference count,
 *         releases the subsidiary's vnode, and eliminates its reference to the
 *         vnode in the device's soft state.
 *     3.  zoneadmd closes the manager and subsidiary sides.
 *     4.  zoneadmd destroys the zcons device and continues to halt the zone.
 *
 * It is necessary for zoneadmd to hold the subsidiary open while issuing
 * ZC_RELEASESUBSID because zcons might otherwise release the last reference to
 * the subsidiary's vnode.  If it does, then specfs will panic because it will
 * expect that the STREAMS configuration for the vnode was destroyed, which
 * VN_RELE doesn't do.  Forcing zoneadmd to hold the subsidiary open guarantees
 * that zcons won't release the vnode's last reference.  zoneadmd will properly
 * destroy the vnode and the snode when it closes the file descriptor.
 *
 * Technically, any process that can access the manager side can issue these
 * ioctls, but they should be treated as private interfaces for zoneadmd.
